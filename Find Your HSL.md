## Find Your HSL

---

This is one of my first projects using `JavaScript` combined with **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
It's a simple webpage divided in 3 sections.
The first section is for the HUE, the second one is for the Saturation and the third one is for the Light.
You can simply change the color by changing one of the parameters in their own text field.

There will be different options to change the fields:

-   By changing the text field.
-   **?** By scrolling with the scrollwheel.
-   **?** By clicking and dropping up and down.
-   **?** By using up and down arrows while the text field is selected.

There will also be:

-   The random color button, which will change the values randomly.
-   An info button, which will display a bit of info about HSL color mode.
-   A copy button, which will copy the color in the correct format straight to the clipboard.

## To Do:

---

-   Info button work.
-   Automatically change color when a different value is set in one of the three fields (color changes while writing).
-   Style the document.
-   Refactor code.
-   **?** Automatically change color when scrolling up and down with the scrollwheel.
